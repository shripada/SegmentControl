# SegmentControl v1.0
A Segment control written in Swift 2.0

#Background
UIKit's UISegmentedControl is nice, but is seriously limited when you need it to have custom height, or want to customize the appearance of selected segments, font colors, borders, etc. SegmentControl addresses these needs well and all written in Swift.

#How to Use?
All implementation comes in a single file SegmentControl.swift. Just include it in your project and you are set to use it in your storyboards right away. Drag and drop a normal view, change its class to SegmentControl. The goodness of @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable will ensure all customizable aspects are neately loaded in the IBInspector and go ahead and start experimenting and see the results live in IB.

Checkout the sample app, and main.xib to see how to use it practically.
